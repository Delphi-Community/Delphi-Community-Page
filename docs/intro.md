# Introduction

This is the documentation for Revived IDE. It also can be used for FreePascal or Lazarus, because Revived IDE is based on them.

## Why Revived IDE?

We have planed major changes on the IDE. Such as dark theme, docked IDE by default, [gtk4 support](https://gtk.org/), Win 11 components, ... Our goal is to rework the IDE completly, which also dropps support for old OS like Win7. Currently we don't know if the Lazarus team would accept those changes. But we don't wanna work against them, just with them thats why 
all changes will be commited to the [Lazarus project](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/lazarus/lazarus).

Also:
- The IDE is free!
- Support multiple plattforms
- Easy installer (Soon)!
- Much more friendly documentation!
