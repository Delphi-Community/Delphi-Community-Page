## Free Pascal

![Free Pascal in terminal](../../static/img/fpc_win.png)

Free Pascal, commonly known as FPC, is a free and open-source compiler for Pascal and Object Pascal languages.
Developed initially in the 1990s, it is designed for cross-platform compatibility, supporting various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
FPC is compatible with Borland Turbo Pascal and Delphi, which makes it appealing for developers transitioning from these environments.
It is known for generating efficient, optimized code and supports modern Pascal features like generics and advanced object-oriented programming.
Free Pascal is often paired with the Lazarus IDE, a robust environment for developing cross-platform GUI applications.
The active community around Free Pascal contributes to its continuous improvement, offering extensive documentation and support, making it a practical choice for both beginners and experienced Pascal programmers.
